Feel free to use this code however you want.
It is SUPER basic. I used it to scrape data from two combinations of drop downs, which provided a calculated number.
These, in the code, are called SMS Credits and Country. 
You can modify this code to work with any website. If you need help feel free to send me a message on one of my socials or leave a comment.
